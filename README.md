This project is a minimal backend service that simulates core post-management functionality for a social media platform. It is built using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. The system supports post creation, feed retrieval using cursor-based pagination, engagement actions (like, comment, share), caching, and concurrency safety using a JSON file as storage.

This project demonstrates backend engineering concepts such as clean architecture, caching strategy, pagination, and concurrency handling.
